# Milano Subway System Planner

A Java application that simulates and queries the Milan Metro subway system.  
Built as part of a course project using **BlueJ** and the `ecs100` graphics library.

The program loads station, line, and timetable data, then provides a GUI to answer queries such as:
- List all stations or subway lines
- Show which stations are on a particular line   
- Find which lines serve a given station
- Check if two stations are on the same line and calculate the distance
- Display the next available train services from a given station
- Plan a trip from one station to another based on time and line schedules

---

## Features
- **Interactive GUI** with buttons for queries and data entry  
- **Data-driven**: Reads station, line, and service information from files in the `/data` folder  
- **Map display**: Draws the subway system map in the application window  
- **Journey planning**: Finds routes and calculates travel distances/times  
- **Timetable integration**: Displays the next available trains after a chosen time
